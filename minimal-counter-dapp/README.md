# Minimalistic Dapp
The example dapp shows how to build a very basic dapp with both backend and fronted, using Motoko for the backend functionality and plain HTML and JavaScript for the frontend. The dapp is a simple counter, which will increment a counter by clicking a button in the frontend.

## Introduction
The purpuse of this example dapp is to build a minimalistic dapp, based on the default dapp template, installed by DFX when creating a new project. The dapp is a simple website with a counter. Every time a button is pressed, a counter is incremented. 

This example covers:

- Create new canister smart contract using the SDK (DFX)
- Use the default project as a template as the starting point for the new project
- Add backend functions for a counter (count, get count and reset count)
- Implement backend functions in the frontend
- Deploy the canister smart contract locally
- Test backend with Candid UI and command line using DFX, and test frontend in browser
